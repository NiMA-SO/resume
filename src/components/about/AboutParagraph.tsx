        Since 1401, when I started studying Network and Software in vocational
        school, I’ve been captivated by the world of front-end development. 🎓
        After researching HTML and CSS on YouTube, I developed a strong interest
        in web development, and since then, I've focused on growing my skills in
        this field. 🌐

        ✨ In front-end development, I’m especially interested in styling,
        working with APIs, and creating responsive designs. These elements
        excite me because they bring dynamic experiences to websites. Currently,
        I’m working on projects like <strong>Movie Hub</strong> and this
        personal resume, and I’m also practicing WordPress. 💻📈
